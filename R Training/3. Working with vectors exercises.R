#### Working with vectors ####

# Vector: sequence of data elements of the same data type
# use c() to concatenate(bind) the numbers together


#### Creating a vector ####


# 1. Create vector M that contains the numbers 10, 4.5, 3.25 and -7.



# 2. Create vector N that contains the strings "This", "Is", "A", "Vector.



# 3. Create vector P that contains the Booleans TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE.



# 4. Create vector Q that contains the numbers 5, 20, -15, -12.



#### Operations on vectors ####


# 5. Add 5 to a vector containing the numbers 3, -5, 1.25, and 15.



# 6. Subtract 7 from a vector containing the numbers 10, 8, 5, and 2.



# 7. Multiply 2.5 by a vector containing the numbers -2.5, 3, 25, and -10.



# 8. Divide a vector containing the numbers 25, 30, -17, and -6 by the number 4.5.



#### Working with multiple vectors ####

# 9. Add a vector containing the numbers 5, 12, 17, and 22 to
#    a vector containing the numbers 7, 10, -3, -22.



# 10. Subtract a vector containing the numbers -4, 7, -2.5, 2.5
#     from a vector containing the numbers 5, -10, 14, -22.



# 11. Multiply the answers from exercises 9 and 10 by each
#     other.



# 12. Divide the answer from exercise 11 by vector M.



# 13. Raise the vector M to the power of a vector containing
#     the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.




#### Assigning vectors to a variable ####

# 14. Assign a vector containing the numbers 4, 2, -2, -4
#     to the variable R.



# 15. Assign a vector containing the numbers 3.25, -5, 1.5, 
#     -12 to the vector S.



# 16. Multiply R by S and assign it to the variable U.



# 17. Use the abs() function to take the absolute value of U and
#     assign that to variable V.



# 18. Take the square root of V and assign it to variable W.



#### Assigning vectors to descriptive variables ####

# Here is a table with total sales of a small corner store
# by category for one week.

#               Mon     Tue      Wed     Thu     Fri     Sat     Sun
# 
# Grocery     146.5   225.7      120    75.2     347    50.3   450.1
#
# Food        247.1   220.1      334   125.1   442.1   523.7     200
#
# Drinks       237     325    173.4   353.7   684.5     545   148.6
#
# Household    75.8    35.1     69.1   147.5    59.7     139    48.2
#
# Misc.        56.2     145    128.4    79.6    37.9   275.1   215.3


# 19. Create 7 vectors that represent purchase amounts for each day of the week.



# 20. Create 5 vectors that represent purchase amounts for each category.



# 21. Use vectors to find the total sales per day.
# Hint: the sum() function may be useful here.



# 22. The store owner realized that he mistyped the drinks sales for Thursday,
#     and it was actually $533.7. Update the drinks vector to reflect the change,
#     and then recalculate total sales for that day.



# 23. How much did the store make in total sales for that week? 
# Hint: the sum() function may be useful here.





# Continue to practice operations until you feel
# comfortable in R. The only way to become truly
# proficient is to spend time coding!
