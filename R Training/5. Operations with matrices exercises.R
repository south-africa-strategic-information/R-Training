#### Adding matrices ####

# 1. Create two matrices. One with the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 in 2 rows labeled mat.1
#    and one with the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 with the same dimension. Both matrices 
#    should have the data by row.



# 2. Add the two matrices together and label it mat.3.



# 3. Subtract mat.2 from mat.1 and label it mat.4.



# 4. Multiply mat.2 by mat.1 and label it mat.5.



# 5. Divide mat.5 by mat.1.



# 6. Check the dimensions of mat.1 and mat.2 and 
#    combine mat.1 and mat.2 by rows and label it mat.6 if you can.



# 7. Combine mat.1 and mat.2 by columns and label it mat.7.



# 8. Check the dimensions of mat.6 and mat.7 and combine them by row or 
#    column if you can.




# Here is a table with total sales of a small corner store by category
# over one week. Use this information for the following questions. 

#               Mon     Tue      Wed     Thu     Fri     Sat     Sun
# 
# Grocery     146.5   225.7      120    75.2     347    50.3   450.1
#
# Food        247.1   220.1      334   125.1   442.1   523.7     200
#
# Drinks       237     325    173.4   353.7   684.5     545   148.6
#
# Household    75.8    35.1     69.1   147.5    59.7     139    48.2
#
# Misc.        56.2     145    128.4    79.6    37.9   275.1   215.3


# 9. Create a matrix with this information. Include the named rows and columns.
#    Label the matrix as total.sales.



# 10. Here are the sales for the following week. Create a matrix total.sales2 for 
#     this information and label the rows and columns as seen in this table.

#     Note: since the names are the same, you will overwrite your previous vectors,
#     but this will not affect the matrix you have already created.

#               Mon     Tue      Wed     Thu     Fri     Sat     Sun
# 
# Grocery     261.5   175.2      120    81.3     272    62.3   251.5
#
# Food        143.2   120.5      174    95.2   472.1   313.4     225
#
# Drinks       148     153    147.1   451.7   581.5     415     182
#
# Household    45.8    53.2     45.2   235.6    39.5     202    38.1
#
# Misc.        31.3     122     99.4    69.7      79   235.3   178.3



# 11. Combine the two matrices with the sales information by column and label
#     it biweekly.sales.



# 12. Add a column to biweekly.sales called Totals that sums up each sales category
#     and label it as biweekly.sales (this will overwrite the previous matrix).



# 13. Now go back and combine the two matrices, total.sales and total.sales2, by row
#     and label it biweekly.sales2.



# 14. Add a row in biweekly.sales2 called Day.Tots with the sum of the columns.



# 15. Add total.sales and total.sales2 together and name it sum.weeks.



# 16. Review the matrices biweekly.sales, biweekly.sales2, and sum.weeks. All three 
#     display the same information, but in different formats. Which do you think 
#     conveys the data most clearly?



# Continue to practice operations until you feel
# comfortable in R. The only way to become truly
# proficient is to spend time coding!
