#==================================================================================

#### Adding numbers: use the + sign ####

4 + 5

# 1. Add 5 and 20.


# 2. Add 4354 and 10405.



#### Subtracting numbers: use the - sign ####

5 - 4

# 3. Subtract 9 from 11.



# 4. Subtract 4304 from 10493.



#### Multiplying numbers: use the * sign ####

5 * 4

# 5. Multiply 30 by 6.



# 6. Multiply 100 by 438.



#### Dividing numbers: use the / sign ####

5 / 4


# 7. Divide 25 by 7.



# 8. Divide 125 by 25.



#### Exponents: use the ^ sign ####

2^5             # "2 to the power of 5"


# 9. Write code for 5 to the power of 10.



# 10. Write code for 3 to the power of 4.



#### Square roots: use sqrt() ####

sqrt(100)


# 11. Write code for the square root of 81.



# 12. Write code for the square root of 150.



#### Combining operations in one line ####

3 + (5-3) * 10

# 13. Write out code to multiply 15 by 20, then take 
#     the square root of that answer and add 14 to it.



# 14. Write out code that multiplies 5 to the power
#     of 3 by 2 and then subtract 25.



# Continue to practice operations until you feel
# comfortable in R. The only way to become truly
# proficient is to spend time coding.
