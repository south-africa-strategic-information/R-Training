#### Create a matrix ####

# Matrices have the data elements of the same type
# arranged in rows and columns.

# 1. Create a matrix with the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 so that it has 2 rows
#    and 3 columns. Label it mat1.



# 2. Create the same matrix by using 3 different ways to code it.



# 3. Create a matrix with the numbers 3-8 that are arranged by row and label it mat2.



# 4. Create the following vectors and then combine them into a matrix with three rows.
#    Make the data go by row, and label that matrix mat3.
# A = numbers 10 through 15
# B = numbers 20 through 25
# D = numbers 30 through 35



# 5. Add a column to mat3 with the numbers 16, 26, and 36 and label it mat4.



# 6. Add a row to mat4 with the numbers 40 through 46 and label it mat5.



# 7. What is the number located in the third row and fourth column of mat5?



# 8. Change the number you found in row 3, column 4 to the number 99.



# 9. Transpose mat5 and label it mat6.



# 10. Rename the rows in mat6 as row1, row2, row3, etc.



# 11. Rename the columns in mat6 as col1, col2, col3, etc.
