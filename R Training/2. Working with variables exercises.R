#### Inputting variables ####

# Input the following numbers as variables. You can use either = or <-

# 1. 20 as A.



# 2. "Hola" as B.



# 3. TRUE as D.

h

# 4. (20 * 3) as E.



#### Combining variables ####


# 5. Add A and E together and assign it to variable G.



# 6. Multiply G by 15 and assign it to variable H.



# 7. Divide H by the sum of A and E and assign it to variable I.



#### Assigning numbers to descriptive variables ####

# In the following exercise, we will use variables to
# find the number of people per table at a party.


# 8. Assign the number 25 to the variable 'people' 
#    and assign the number 5 to a variable 'tables'.



# 9. Divide people by tables and label it as people.per.table.




#### Replacing variables ####


# 10. Relabel the variable people as 45.



# 11. Divide people by tables and label it as more.people.


#### Operations with variables ####

# 12. Add A and H.



# 13. Subtract B from E.



# 14. Multiply A by E.



# 15. Divide H by I.



# 16. Raise H to the power of 3 and label it K.



# 17. Take the square root of K and label it L.



# 18. Multiply I by the sum of A and E. Set it equal to J.



# Continue to practice operations until you feel
# comfortable in R. The only way to become truly
# proficient is to spend time coding!
