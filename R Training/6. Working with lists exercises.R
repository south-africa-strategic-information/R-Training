#### CREATING LISTS ####

# 1. Create a list with the elements TRUE, 27, "aa", "John" and label it list1.



# 2. Add the element FALSE to list1.



# 3. Remove the first element, TRUE, from list1.



# 4. Replace the second element in list1 with the element "cc".



# 5. Name the elements in the list as A, B, D, E.



# 6. Create a list with the following elements and name it list2:
#    Dave, Erin, Natalie
#    Dobson, Ericsson, Wolfe
#    39, 31, 33
#    Accountant, Teacher, Engineer



# 7. Name the elements in list2 as First.name, Last.name, Age, Job.



# 8. Add an element to list2 called "Housing" with the data "Apt", "House", "Condo".



# 9. In list2, replace the first number in "Age" with the number 37.



# 10. Delete the "Condo" element in "Housing" in list2.



# 11. Add "Townhouse" to the "Housing" element in list2.



# Here is information about five customers, items they purchased,
# quantity of items, and whether or not they're part of the
# store membership program.
#
# Kallie, bananas, 5, TRUE
# Corey, oranges, 4, FALSE
# Abigail, apples, 10, FALSE
# Carl, lemons, 2, TRUE
# Mitch, grapefruit, 3, TRUE

# 12. Create a list that contains the following named categories:
#     "Names", "Items", "Quantity", and "Membership".



# 13. Create a data frame from that list.



# Here is more information about additional purchases that the customers made:
#
# Kallie, 5 bananas, 4 tomatoes, 3 cucumbers, TRUE
# Corey, 2 apples, 1 lemon, 4 oranges, FALSE
# Abigail, 5 tomatoes, 3 limes, 10 apples, FALSE
# Carl, 2 lemons, 6 avocadoes, 8 tomatoes, TRUE
# Mitch, 5 tomatoes, 3 grapefruit, 2 cucumbers, TRUE

# 14. Create a list for each customer. Label the list as the customer name, and 
#     name the elements as "Items", "Quantity", and "Membership".



# 15. Once these lists are created, use the cbind function to arrange each list  
#     by column and assign them to a variable.
#     Hint: The first element in each should be the name of the customer.



# 16. Next, use the rbind function to combine all of these into a variable called 
#     Customer.purchases.



# 17. Rename the columns to match the categories from the lists.




# Continue to practice these operations until you feel
# comfortable in R. The only way to become truly
# proficient is to spend time coding!
